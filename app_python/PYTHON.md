## Framework Choice

In this project, we utilized the Flask web framework for building the Python web application. Flask was chosen for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use. It is a lightweight framework that provides the necessary tools to create web applications without imposing a rigid structure. Flask allows developers to choose their preferred tools and libraries for different components, providing a more customizable development experience.

The decision to use Flask was based on the project's requirements, where a straightforward and scalable solution was needed. Flask's modular design and extensive documentation made it a suitable choice for quickly implementing the desired functionality.

## Best Practices

### Project Structure
We followed a modular project structure to organize the code logically. The application code is separated into modules, promoting maintainability and scalability.

### PEP 8 Compliance

We adhered to the PEP 8 style guide for Python code, promoting consistency and readability. This includes guidelines on indentation, line length, import formatting, and naming conventions.

## Testing

Due to the simplicity of the web application, testing is primarily conducted through manual testing by refreshing the page to ensure the time is being updated accurately. As the primary functionality involves displaying the current time in Moscow, this straightforward approach provides a quick and effective means of verification.
