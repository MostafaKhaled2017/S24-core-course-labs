## Framework Choice

In this project, we utilized the Flask web framework for building the Python web application. Flask was chosen for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use. It is a lightweight framework that provides the necessary tools to create web applications without imposing a rigid structure. Flask allows developers to choose their preferred tools and libraries for different components, providing a more customizable development experience.

The decision to use Flask was based on the project's requirements, where a straightforward and scalable solution was needed. Flask's modular design and extensive documentation made it a suitable choice for quickly implementing the desired functionality.

## Best Practices

### Project Structure
We followed a modular project structure to organize the code logically. The application code is separated into modules, promoting maintainability and scalability.

### PEP 8 Compliance

We adhered to the PEP 8 style guide for Python code, promoting consistency and readability. This includes guidelines on indentation, line length, import formatting, and naming conventions.

## Testing

The project integrates unit test to validate crucial functionalities using the `unittest` module in Python. The `test_app.py` file now includes a test function, `test_get_moscow_time`, specifically designed for the `get_moscow_time` function in the `app.py` file.

### Function: `test_get_moscow_time`
- **Description:** Tests the `get_moscow_time` function, which retrieves and formats the current time in Moscow.
- **Best Practices Applied:**
  - **Descriptive Naming:** The test function is aptly named to clearly convey its purpose.
  - **Comparison Against Expected Results:** The result is compared against the expected current time in Moscow, ensuring the accuracy of the function.

This unit test adheres to best practices, providing a reliable mechanism for verifying the accuracy and functionality of the critical `get_moscow_time` component within the Python web application.
