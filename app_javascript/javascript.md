# JavaScript Web Application

## Frameworks Used

In the development of our JavaScript web application that displays the current time in Moscow, we opted for a minimalistic approach and did not rely on any specific frameworks. Instead, we leveraged core web technologies to keep the application lightweight and straightforward. The main components include:

1. **HTML**: The standard markup language for creating the structure of the web page.

2. **CSS**: Used for styling and layout, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience.

3. **JavaScript**: The core scripting language that powers the dynamic functionality of the application.

## Best Practices Applied

In the development of this JavaScript web application, we followed several best practices to ensure code quality, maintainability, and performance:

- **Separation of Concerns**: The project adheres to the principle of separating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into distinct files, promoting better organization and maintainability.

- **Responsive Design**: The CSS styles are designed to create a responsive layout, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

- **Modular JavaScript**: The JavaScript code is organized into functions, promoting modularity and reusability. This structure enhances code readability and simplifies debugging and maintenance.

By adhering to these best practices, we aimed to create a clean, maintainable, and efficient JavaScript web application that serves its purpose effectively. Developers can easily extend or modify the codebase while maintaining a high standard of code quality.


## Testing

Due to the simplicity of the web application, testing is primarily conducted through manual testing by refreshing the page to ensure the time is being updated accurately. As the primary functionality involves displaying the current time in Moscow, this straightforward approach provides a quick and effective means of verification.
